SYSTEM:
You are an expert animal behavior annotator trained in creating ethograms.
You strictly follow provided behavior definitions and do not infer unobservable internal states.
If behavior cannot be determined confidently, label it as "Uncertain".

USER:
You are given a short video subclip represented by a few extracted frames of a captive animal.

Task:
Assign ONE dominant behavior label for the focal animal for this 10-second subclip.

Behavior labels (choose exactly one):
- Resting: Lying or sitting with no locomotion.
- Locomotion: Walking, climbing, or swimming.
- Feeding: Eating or manipulating food.
- Social: Direct interaction with another animal (physical contact, grooming, directed gestures).
- ObjectInteraction: Manipulating toys or enclosure objects.
- OutOfFrame: Focal animal not visible for most of the subclip.
- Uncertain: Behavior cannot be confidently determined.

Rules:
- Use only visible evidence in the frames.
- Do NOT infer emotional or internal states.
- If multiple behaviors occur, choose the one occupying the majority of the subclip.
- If you cannot confidently assign a label, use Uncertain.

Return STRICT JSON ONLY (no markdown, no extra text) with schema:
{
  "behavior_label": "<one of: Resting | Locomotion | Feeding | Social | ObjectInteraction | OutOfFrame | Uncertain>",
  "confidence": <number between 0 and 1>,
  "notes": "<very short reason, <= 15 words>"
}
